## Blog

    I want to write a blog about the current condition 2020
    Working as a essential service during a pandemic
    How we have stressed new safe work policy’s  to maintain safety and how this has affected our work under these condition’

    How buildings that are at less then half capacity still require maintenance.
    Revolving work force require a higher demand on employee’s that remain active 

    Thats all i got for now
