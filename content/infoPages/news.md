Something new has begun at WinnPro Construction. We are very proud to announce the construction of our New Head Office. We have been growing as a company over the last few years. Having a fresh, contemporary work space where we can merge our Accounting Department and Construction Office together under one roof will allow for an optimal work environment for both in the office and out in the field.

The new office will be located on Speers Rd., and the building will be just over 5000SQ ft. Construction is already in motion, and we plan to be completed and ready to move- in the New Year! We’re on the edge of our seats with excitement and anticipation to see what the end results will look like; but for now–take a look at the progress we have so far!
