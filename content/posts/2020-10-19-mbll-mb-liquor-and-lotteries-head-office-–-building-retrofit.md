#### Project Overview

Boasting a stunning front entrance, we constructed a new 2-storey addition at the front of an existing office building. This modern structure features floor-to-ceiling windows and angled exterior beams, providing a bold gateway for their head office.

With this project we needed to consider the impact of the renovation to the work area, minimizing impact to the employee workspace while enhancing their environment with state-of-the-art board rooms and collaboration space.

#### The Results

An elegant example of commercial needs meeting architectural design, we’re pleased to have been a part of this recent addition to Winnipeg’s cityscape.
