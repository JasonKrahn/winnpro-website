#### Project Overview

Partnering with Mark’s and the Canadian Tire Corporation, we renovated their new impressive, expanded space in the [West Edmonton Mall](https://www.wem.ca/). While collaborating with Mark’s wasn’t a new concept for us, this was WinnPro’s first project at this site.

#### The Results

The construction of this space improvement commenced in May 2015. Keeping true to the companies design and working with them to build according to their standards and guidelines, helped us complete this project on schedule
