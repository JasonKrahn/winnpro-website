#### Project Overview

Since emerging into the Canadian market in the late 1980s, there has been widespread development and clustering of big box stores into a broad range of power centre locations, including in Winnipeg’s largest retail node, Stadium Centre by Polo Park.

#### The Results

Stadium Centre is a 22,500 square foot commercial space development that offers Large Box CRU (commercial rental unit) opportunities in a prime retail hub. WinnPro Construction was involved with this project from the beginning, working with the owner and architect through the site works, multiple tenant mixes and varying configurations of the 4 buildings involved.

The project was completed in the fall of 2015.
