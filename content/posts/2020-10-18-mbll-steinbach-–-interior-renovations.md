#### Project Overview

This 2 phase interior remodelling project brought in a touch of elegance, design and calm into a busy retail space. Focused on customer experience, MLCC Steinbach was looking to provide a tailored climate to their customers while better managing store traffic.

The retail area remained open during the renovation, and included the addition of a wine sampling area, relocation the cash desks and additional design elements to the drywall bulkheads. New office space, washrooms and a more functional warehouse rounds out the scope of this project.

#### The Results

We are pleased to have worked with MLCC on delivering this class-act retail environment, minimizing the impact on the customer experience during construction, delivering on time and on budget.
