At the end of July, Mastermind Toys will be opening their second location in Winnipeg. With over 30 years in business and 51+ stores across Canada; it’s no surprise that Mastermind Toy’s is Canada’s largest specialty toy and children’s book retailer.

With business expanding at Kildonan Place Mall, there is no doubt this is an exciting time for any business owner. We enjoy being a part of their journey; and to be a part of Mastermind Toys’ expansion was a pleasure.
