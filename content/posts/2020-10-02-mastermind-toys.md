#### Project Overview

At the end of July, Mastermind Toys will be opening their second location in Winnipeg. With over 30 years in business and 51+ stores across Canada; it’s no surprise that Mastermind Toy’s is Canada’s largest specialty toy and children’s book retailer.

#### Results

With business expanding at Kildonan Place Mall, there is no doubt this is an exciting time for any business owner. We enjoy being a part of their journey; and to be a part of Mastermind Toys’ expansion was a pleasure.
