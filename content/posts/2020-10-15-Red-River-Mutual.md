#### Project Overview

From concept to completion, this project involved reusing the existing shell of an old auto body shop and adding 5100 square feet to create the new Regional Office for Red River Mutual.

Aware of the impact projects can have on the environment, it was a priority to include recycled materials during construction; we reused the existing block steel and foundation grade beams and interior/exterior finishes had recycled content

#### Results

The ribbon cutting ceremony took place June 2013 where we were pleased to celebrate the successful completion of another well-designed building in our thriving community.
