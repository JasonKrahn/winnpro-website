#### Project Overview

The city of Selkirk is a growing community, and has an abundance of opportunity for businesses to flourish. We were explicitly honored to be in partnership with the Canadian Tire Corporation once again, to aid in the advancement the city, by expanding the existing Mark’s store and constructing Selkirk’s first Sport Chek.

Despite the elements and the conditions that threatened to delay this project, we concentrated our resources to ensure this project was completed as scheduled.

#### The Results

Construction commenced in June 2015, and both projects were complete and open for business before the busy holiday season in November of 2015.
