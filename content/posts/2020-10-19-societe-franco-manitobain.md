#### Project Overview

Nestled in the heart of St. Boniface, what was formerly an empty space would soon be modern office space boasting unique features, including floor to ceiling glass walls that brought the benefits of transparency, daylighting, versatility, efficiency, and space saving to this uplifting workspace.

#### The Results

Incorporating a sleek, curved wall feature throughout the building also enhanced the aesthetics and fluidity in the design. It’s been said that creating a curved environment to work in is linked with positive emotions, which is known to be beneficial for creativity and productivity. Rounded environments have also ranked more pleasing and inviting when compared to space that was rectangular. One thing we know for sure, this was project we are proud to have been a part of – with a stunning and unique end result to look back on.
