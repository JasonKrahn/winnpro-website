#### Project Overview

This makes the **2nd** Jollibee in Winnipeg, and the **2nd** Jollibee in Canada!

As the General Contractor for the **Interior Fit-Up** we were honoured to have this opportunity yet again!

Working in partnership with Raymond S.C. Wan Architect and alongside with the Jollibee Team, together we were able to see this project come to life from beginning to end.

#### Results

We’re very delighted to have completed Jollibee-Northgate just before the *hustling* Holiday Season.
