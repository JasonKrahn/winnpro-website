#### Project Overview

Canada’s first Jollibee has finally landed here in Winnipeg and WinnPro was awarded the opportunity to be the General Contractor. We’ve had the pleasure of working directly with the Jollibee Team as well as Raymond S.C. Wan Architect to complete the project just in time for the busy Christmas season.

Starting out as a small family owned ice-cream shop in the mid 70’s, Jollibee has grown to be the largest fast-food restaurant in the Philippines. Known as the McDonalds of Asia; its fast growth is evident with having over 3,000 stores worldwide. With a menu that consists of their famous Chickenjoy, Jollibee Spaghetti, Yum and Champ Burger with many more items, you’re bound to find something to enjoy. Excited as we have been throughout the last couple months bringing this project come to life, we can’t imagine the excitement Jollibee will be for Winnipeg’s Filipino community.
