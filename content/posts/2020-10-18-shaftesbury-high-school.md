#### Project Overview

When Shaftesbury High School decided to renovate and build a new library on the second floor they didn’t stop there. They also created four classrooms and a resource area on the main floor. We were pleased to be the general contractors for this project.

Shaftesbury’s innovative library that features a laptop bar, a wall of cafe-style seating overlooking their sports field, to the reading nook tucked beside the fireplace – and did you know the lighting changes automatically depending on the natural light in the space?

#### The Result

Being a part of projects like this that help develop our children is one more reason why we love what we do – building innovative spaces that build strong people.
