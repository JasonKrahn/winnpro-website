    title: Project Management
  - description: We specialize in construction management/general contracting services, an innovative procurement method that involves early partnering between owner, designer, and contractor to jointly develop projects. This approach enables owners to benefit from designer and contractor expertise at an early stage in the procurement process, ensuring maximum opportunities for value engineering.
    title: General Contracting
  - description: Design-build streamlines project delivery through a single contract between the owner and the design-build team to provide design and construction services. This simple but fundamental difference in project delivery saves money and time by transforming the relationship between designers and builders into an alliance which fosters collaboration and teamwork. The design-build provides the owner with the design and construction. By giving the client what is in his or her best interest, the entire process is able to go much smoother. It allows you to start with just a concept or vision, and we provide the rest. We assume responsibility for design and take on all pricing and timing risk.
