  - description: Design-build streamlines project delivery through a single contract
      between the owner and the design-build team to provide design and
      construction services. This simple but fundamental difference in project
      delivery saves money and time by transforming the relationship between
      designers and builders into an alliance which fosters collaboration and
      teamwork. The design-build provides the owner with the design and
      construction. By giving the client what is in his or her best interest,
      the entire process is able to go much smoother. It allows you to start
      with just a concept or vision, and we provide the rest. We assume
      responsibility for design and take on all pricing and timing risk.
