  ## Project Management


  Project management is known to be a combination of art and science; involving planning, organizing, controlling and leading. With a wide range of dedicated licensed sub-trades and a full suite of project management services, our team strategically controls the key elements of time, quality, flexibility, risk and cost. Our team ensures your goals are met and results are delivered. Combining the science of project management with the art of our experience and knowledge, we direct and motivate all parties involved in a project in order to ensure its success


  ## General Contracting


  We specialize in construction management/general contracting services, an innovative procurement method that involves early partnering between owner, designer, and contractor to jointly develop projects. This approach enables owners to benefit from designer and contractor expertise at an early stage in the procurement process, ensuring maximum opportunities for value engineering.


  ## Design Build


  Design-build streamlines project delivery through a single contract between the owner and the design-build team to provide design and construction services. This simple but fundamental difference in project delivery saves money and time by transforming the relationship between designers and builders into an alliance which fosters collaboration and teamwork. The design-build provides the owner with the design and construction. By giving the client what is in his or her best interest, the entire process is able to go much smoother. It allows you to start with just a concept or vision, and we provide the rest. We assume responsibility for design and take on all pricing and timing risk.


  ## Building Maintenance


  A well-maintained workplace can create the right impression, improve employee efficiency, and reduce your operational costs while keeping the customer experience a priority.Our experienced building maintenance team can do any repairs or upgrades that your building requires to keep it safe, welcoming to your customers and functional for your team. This includes repairing or replacing flooring, walls, ceilings, counter tops, cabinets, washroom or kitchen or change room fixtures, glass and mirrors, interior signs or banners, roofs, sales displays and shelving, emergency lighting, testing of fire extinguishers (and all other items installed for safety) and any other repairs or maintenance that you may require.
